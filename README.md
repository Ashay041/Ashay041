###  About Me

Backend Engineer (AI) | Building systems people depend on

I am Ashay Koradia. I'm a backend engineer building scalable systems with Python, JavaScript, AWS, and Kubernetes. My work focuses on distributed systems, event-driven architecture, and AI/ML infrastructure.

My journey & learnings along the way:

**1. STRATIT - AI Medical Transcription**
Building HIPAA-compliant AI platform processing 500+ patient conversations daily using Python, FastAPI, Hugging Face, and AWS. If my system fails to register data correctly on the EHR, someone's medical claim gets affected.

Learnings: Cost is part of system architecture, not an afterthought. A solution that scales and meets requirements isn't the right solution if it doesn't meet cost requirements. Production systems balance performance, reliability, and operational costs.

**2. TraceLink - Pharmaceutical Supply Chain**
Built event-driven low-code platform processing 10K+ daily operations for Fortune 500 clients. Cut deployment cycles from weeks to hours and operational costs by 40%. Built recall management system processing FDA notifications across 200+ centers, reducing response time from months to days.

Learnings: When something breaks, don't just fix it. You're building teams, not code. Make sure the team learns from mistakes and prevents recurrence rather than applying quick fixes. That's how you build resilient systems and teams.

**3. Acquia - Cloud Infrastructure**
Migrated infrastructure to Kubernetes serving 35 billion monthly page views. Reduced latency by 60%, cut costs by $50K annually. Built monitoring infrastructure that decreased outages by 45%.

Learnings: Learned to learn quickly and work in iterations with frequent feedback. Learned the Kaizen approach: what to change next sprint, what to continue, what to stop. That framework shaped how I approach continuous improvement.

**5. menoVa.ai - Founding Engineer (CMU)
**Built RAG-powered AI health platform using Python, FastAPI, and LangChain that scaled to 350+ messages/day. Interviewed 30+ women about their needs before writing code.

Technical Skills:
Python, JavaScript, TypeScript, Go, Java | FastAPI, Node.js, Flask, GraphQL, REST APIs | AWS (EC2, S3, SageMaker), Kubernetes (CKAD), Docker, Terraform | PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Redis | Jenkins CI/CD, GitHub Actions, SumoLogic | Distributed Systems, Microservices, Event-Driven Architecture, Message Queues

Hobbies: Composing music on piano, sound mixing, and playing table tennis.

Education: Carnegie Mellon University
