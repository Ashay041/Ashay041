### Hello there 👋![](.png)
###  About Me

I'm a backend engineer building scalable systems with Python, JavaScript, AWS, and Kubernetes. My work focuses on distributed systems, event-driven architecture, and AI/ML infrastructure.

Education: Carnegie Mellon University

My journey & learnings along the way:

**1. STRATIT - AI Medical Transcription**
Learnings: Cost is part of system architecture, not an afterthought. A solution that scales and meets requirements isn't the right solution if it doesn't meet cost requirements. Production systems balance performance, reliability, and operational costs.

**2. TraceLink - Pharmaceutical Supply Chain**
Learnings: When something breaks, don't just fix it. You're building teams, not code. Make sure the team learns from mistakes and prevents recurrence rather than applying quick fixes. That's how you build resilient systems and teams.

**5. menoVa.ai - Founding Engineer (CMU)** My team and I founded Menova.ai at the CMU Swartz Centre for Entrepreneurship. Menova.ai helps women going through menopause with personalized guidance and AI-driven support.
